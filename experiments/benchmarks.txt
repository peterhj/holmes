# Convolutional Nets

In `tools/bench-net.rs`, benchmarking small candidate nets for the rollout
policy. Notably, using cuDNN convolutions and temporary no-op softmaxes, can
evaluate 210k states/s (conv1 is 9x9x4x16, conv2 is 3x3x16x1).

Additionally, copying memory seems to fairly efficient. Copying to the device
seems to be more performant than copying to the host, but having both in a tight
loop only degrades performance of the above net by about 10%.

# Checking fast legal moves during rollouts

This results in about a 15x slowdown in its current form.
